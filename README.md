# Lynx

- **[Lynx Alpha Site](https://google.com)** _insert link here once deployed_

Lynx connects suppliers & wholesalers and brings transparency to the supply chain by utilizing smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain.

This application was built in three weeks as a Capstone Project for the Flex Immersive program at [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/).

Because Lynx is not intended for commercial use (yet!), the Ganache test blockchain was used for deployment, rather than the Ethereum Main Network, where payment (gas) is required to make transactions.
