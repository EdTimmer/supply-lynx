#### Lynx: A solution for the logistics challenge faced by producers, suppliers, and wholesalers.

## Why does Lynx exist?
Supply chains are incredibly complex. They often span multiple geographies and involve several stakeholders. Goods can take months to flow to the end user.

Currently, there is a lack of transparency in the supply chain. Producers, middlemen, and wholesalers don't know:
1. Where goods come from - the previous places they've been physically
2. The timing of the changes made 
3. The quality & authenticity of goods
3. The path 
ETC ETC ETC

Lynx utilizes blockchain technology to help solve some of these problems.

## Introduction to blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger. 

The key innovations of a blockchain are:
- Immutability / security (no ability to falsify)
- Transparency - everyone can see the transactions
- Disintermediation - no need for a trusted third party

### The difference between blockchain and cryptocurrency

But isn't all of this just contrived? Does it actually have any value?

#### Sidenote regarding money
Since we normally transact in currencies issued by governments, it is a common misconception that those [fiat currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) are the only form of money. However, these are a relatively recent technology and are not synonomous with the concept of money.

Money has three neccesisary components. It is a:
1. [Medium of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange)
2. [Unit of account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_account)
3. [Store of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value)

If something fulfills these three criteria, it is money. In short, _if a sufficient number of people believe something to be money - and use it as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value - it **is** money._

## Advantages of blockchain in the supply chain

While the most prominent use of blockchain is in the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, the reality is that blockchain—essentially a distributed, digital ledger—has many applications and can be used for any exchange, agreements/contracts, tracking and, of course, payment. Since every transaction is recorded on a block and across multiple copies of the ledger that are distributed over many nodes (computers), it is highly transparent. It’s also highly secure since every block links to the one before it and after it. There is not one central authority over the blockchain, and it’s extremely efficient and scalable. Ultimately, blockchain can increase the efficiency and transparency of supply chains and positively impact everything from warehousing to delivery to payment. Chain of command is essential for many things, and blockchain has the chain of command built in.

The transparency of blockchain is also crucial to allow consumers to know they are supporting companies who they share the same values of environmental stewardship and sustainable manufacturing. This is what the project Provenance hopes to provide with its blockchain record of transparency.

Diamond-giant De Beers uses blockchain technology to track stones from the point they are minded right up to the point when they are sold to consumers. This ensures the company avoids ‘conflict’ or ‘blood diamonds’ and assures the consumers that they are buying the genuine article.

There are several supply chain startups such as Cloud Logistics who saw an opportunity to provide blockchain-enabled supply chain solutions to improve efficiencies and reduce costs for the massive supply chain industry. More will most certainly join them as they realize the potential and demand for blockchain-enabled solutions to transform the supply chain and logistics industry.


To understand the enthusiasm in this modern currency, it helps to think about a very old one. Until the early 20th century the people on Yap, an island in the Pacific Ocean, used large stone disks (pictured) as money for big expenses, such as a daughter’s dowry. Being very heavy, they were rarely moved when spent. Instead, they simply changed owners. Every transaction became part of an oral history of ownership, which allowed islanders to know the proprietor of each stone and made it difficult to spend the same stone twice.

Bitcoins also don’t move around when they are transferred. They are best understood as entries in a giant ledger, the “blockchain”, which contains the transaction history for every Bitcoin in circulation. It is kept up to date with the help of cryptography and copious computing power, provided by a global network of tens of thousands of computers. Again, openness helps the system remain secure: the blockchain is public so every participant can check whether a transfer comes from the rightful owner.

This set-up is the first workable solution to one of the more nagging problems of the digital realm: how to transfer something of value from one person to another without middlemen having to make sure that the item is not copied or, in the case of money, spent more than once? And Bitcoin does the trick while being open (unlike conventional payment mechanisms, which aim for security by shielding themselves from outsiders). This means that third parties can make use of Bitcoin’s features without having to ask anyone for permission—as is the case with the internet.

Such “permissionless innovation”, in the jargon, should in time result in a cornucopia of applications. Bitcoin’s technology could be used to transfer ownership both in other currencies and of any kind of financial asset. This, in turn, would allow the creation of decentralised exchanges which let asset holders trade directly. And money could be “programmed” to come with conditions: for instance, it might be released only if a third person agrees.

Some want ownership of devices—a car, say—to be represented by a Bitcoin, or a tiny fraction of it. The car would work only when turned on with a key that includes the Bitcoin token. This would make managing ownership of and access to physical assets much easier: the token could be sold or rented out temporarily, enabling flexible peer-to-peer car-rental schemes. Such “smart property” would turn the blockchain into a global registry of ownership in physical assets.

All that may sound like science fiction, but a growing number of startups are working on bringing such applications to market. Coloured Coins and Mastercoin will soon release software that enables trade in other financial assets, including stocks and bonds. The most ambitious project is Ethereum: it will launch a new blockchain, similar but unrelated to Bitcoin, with a programming language to encode financial instruments and other contracts.

Although banks have mostly steered clear of Bitcoin as a currency, they too have started exploring how they could use the technology in other ways. They are unlikely to move fast, but there are plenty of possibilities. Global banks could, for instance, use Bitcoin-like systems to move money between subsidiaries. They could even issue their own crypto-currencies.

What is the blockchain?
A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. It is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties, and, by design, it is unchangeable. Blockchains are typically managed using a peer-to-peer network that collectively adheres to a set of rules for adding new blocks to the chain.

What is a cryptocurrency?
A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control that works through a blockchain, functioning as a distributed ledger. Ether and bitcoin are examples of cryptocurrencies.

Which cryptocurrency do you use?
Block & Mortar is built on the Ethereum blockchain, using "ether," a cryptocurrency, "wei," a smaller denomination of ether, and "gas," a measure of the cost of writing to the blockchain. Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

What is a digital wallet?
A digital wallet is an electronic address that allows an individual to make electronic transactions. A digital wallet can be linked to a user's bank account, and can be used to make transactions with a variety of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether.

How does this all work? What is a smart contract?
Smart contracts live on the blockchain, providing a set of rules that facilitate and codify interactions between two or more parties. Block and Mortar's smart contract, for example, provides a framework for interaction between buyers and sellers. The smart contract captures information about the sale, resulting in the transfer of ether from buyer to seller only upon receipt on the good or service in question.

Why am I being charged a transaction fee to post or purchase a service?
Blockchain operations require computational resources, as specific nodes across the blockchain network (called "miners") must validate, secure, and store transactions. "Gas" accounts for the cost of these computations. The tranasction fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit (a unit of measurement) by the gas price (measured in a small denomination of ether called gwei, or wei); both of these are set by you, the user, when interacting with the blockchain through Metamask.
